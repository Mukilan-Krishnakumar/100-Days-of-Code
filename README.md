## Day 2 (09 March 2022)
Today, I learnt about the introduction of arrow function in ES6. Arrow functions make our job so easy and are relatively easy to understand. I also learnt about Classes being syntatic sugar. **Classes use the prototype-based inheritance by using constructors**

## Day 3 (10 March 2022)
Today, I learnt about **this** keyword and how the value of this depends on the context in which it is used. I also learnt the reason why **Object Composition** is being used in **React** rather than **Inheritance**.
